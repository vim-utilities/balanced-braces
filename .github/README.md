## Configuration
[heading__configuration]:
  #configuration
  "&#x1F523; How to configure plugin behavior/features"


Existing defaults may be modified or extended by assigning `g:balanced_braces` variable within the `~/.vimrc` file for a given account. Example of defaults...


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = {
      \   'exclude': [],
      \   'all': {
      \     'parentheses': { 'open': '(', 'close': ')' },
      \     'curly-brace': { 'open': '{', 'close': '}' },
      \     'square-bracket': { 'open': '[', 'close': ']' },
      \   },
      \ }
```


Exclude example...


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = {
     \   'exclude': [ 'help', 'markdown' ],
     \ }
```


Example of adding angle-bracket support...


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = {
      \   'all': {
      \     'angle-bracket': { 'open': '<', 'close': '>' },
      \   },
      \ }
```


Filetype customization example


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = {
      \   'html': {
      \     'angle-bracket': { 'open': '<', 'close': '>' },
      \   },
      \ }
```


Remove `all` entry example...


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = {
     \   'all': {
     \     'square-bracket': false,
     \   },
     \ }
```


---


Alternatively one may instead assign a JSON file path to the `g:balanced_braces` variable to customize configurations, eg...


```JSON
{
  "exclude": [],
  "all": {
    "parentheses": {
      "open": "(",
      "close": ")"
    },
    "curly-brace": {
      "open": "{",
      "close": "}"
    },
    "square-bracket": {
      "open": "[",
      "close": "]"
    }
  },
  "html": {
    "angle-bracket": {
      "open": "<",
      "close": ">"
    }
  }
}
```


Configuration via JSON file path example...


```Vim
let g:balanced_braces = '~/.vim/configs/balanced-braces.json'
```

### Forking
[heading__forking]:
  #forking
  "&#x1F531; Tips for forking balanced-braces"


Start making a [Fork][balanced_braces__fork_it] of this repository to an account that you have write permissions for.


- Add remote for fork URL. The URL syntax is _`git@github.com:<NAME>/<REPO>.git`_...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/vim-utilities/balanced-braces

git remote add fork git@github.com:<NAME>/balanced-braces.git
```


- Commit your changes and push to your fork, eg. to fix an issue...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/vim-utilities/balanced-braces


git commit -F- <<'EOF'
:bug: Fixes #42 Issue


**Edits**


- `<SCRIPT-NAME>` script, fixes some bug reported in issue
EOF


git push fork main
```


> Note, the `-u` option may be used to set `fork` as the default remote, eg. _`git push -u fork main`_ however, this will also default the `fork` remote for pulling from too! Meaning that pulling updates from `origin` must be done explicitly, eg. _`git pull origin main`_


- Then on GitHub submit a Pull Request through the Web-UI, the URL syntax is _`https://github.com/<NAME>/<REPO>/pull/new/<BRANCH>`_


> Note; to decrease the chances of your Pull Request needing modifications before being accepted, please check the [dot-github](https://github.com/vim-utilities/.github) repository for detailed contributing guidelines.
